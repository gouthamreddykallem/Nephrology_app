# Kidney Care

## Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)
Chronic Kidney Disease is characterized by the gradual loss of kidney function over time. It affects 26 million Americans while there are millions of others who are at risk. It is followed by complications like high blood pressure, anemia, weak bones, poor nutritional health and nerve damage.
CKD stages based on GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate):

Stage 1: GFR > 90 – Normal kidney function
Stage 2: GFR 60-89 – Mild kidney damage
Stage 3: GFR 30-59 – Moderate kidney damage
Stage 4: GFR 15-29 – Severe kidney damage
Stage 5: GFR < 15 – Kidney failure (End Stage Renal Disease)


Treatments include:
- Glomerulonephropathy
- Interstitial disease
- Diabetic Kidney Disease
- Hereditary Kidney Disease
- Mineral metabolism
- Nutritional Consultation & Management
- Anemia Management & Administration of ESA
- Electrolyte Management
- Kidney Stone Work-up & Treatment
- Ultrasound facilities
- Access to second opinions

## End Stage Renal Disease
End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) is when the kidneys stop functioning well enough for someone to live without dialysis or a transplant. People with diabetes or high blood pressure are at increased risk.

Services for ESRD patients:
- Regular hemodialysis (at home or in hospital)
- Peritoneal Dialysis (manual and automated)
- Kidney Transplant Management - Pre and Post-Transplant Care
- Nocturnal Hemodialysis
- Home dialysis

## Kidney Stones
Kidney stones are solid concretions formed from dietary minerals in the urine. Common causes include dehydration, diets, metabolic conditions, and other diseases.

Treatment involves hydration, pain medication, and time. In severe cases, other methods include medication to speed passage, ESWL (Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy), and/or surgery.

## Kidney Transplant
The Nephrology group works with various medical centers for kidney transplants, including California Pacific Medical Center Transplant Center, Stanford University Medical, University of California Davis, UCLA, and UCSF.

## Vascular Access
Types of vascular access:
1. Arteriovenous Fistula (AV fistula)

#Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

What are Renal Physicians?
A Renal Physician or Nephrologist is a doctor who specializes in kidneys. They diagnose and care for patients with kidney diseases.

What do kidneys do?
Kidneys filter waste products and regulate fluid and electrolytes in the body. They also produce hormones to regulate blood pressure, produce blood cells, and maintain bone health.

What is the GFR?
The Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) measures kidney function through a calculation of serum creatinine, age, and gender. It's measured during a 24-hour urine collection.

What is CKD?
CKD stands for Chronic Kidney Disease. It's a condition where kidney damage or reduced function persists for over 3 months. The leading causes are diabetes and high blood pressure.

What tests can detect CKD?
Tests include blood pressure analysis, serum creatinine levels, and urine albumin. Your nephrologist may order more detailed tests based on your condition.

What medications can I take if I have CKD?
Patients with CKD should avoid NSAIDs, IV dyes, certain enemas, laxatives, and herbal products. Always consult your renal physician before starting any new medications.

What happens if my kidneys fail?
Kidney failure leads to uremia, where the body fills with extra water and waste products. Without treatment (dialysis or kidney transplant), it can lead to seizures, coma, and death. Patients have the right to refuse or withdraw from treatment.
